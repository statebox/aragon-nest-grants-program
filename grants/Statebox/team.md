- affiliation: Quantum Group, University of Oxford 
- expertise: Process theories, quantum mechanics, diagrammatic languages
- education: PhD Physics, Vrije Universiteit Brussels

> Bob is Professor of Quantum Foundations, Logic and Structures at University of Oxford, and a pioneer in the field of categorical quantum mechanics and diagrammatic reasoning, of which his book [Picturing Quantum Processes](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/picturing-quantum-processes/1119568B3101F3A685BE832FEEC53E52) is probably one of the most complete references.

## Brendan Fong

Brendan is helping us with some of the category-theoretic gadgets to turn Petri nets into a compositional framework.

- affiliation: Department of Mathematics, MIT
- education: DPhil Computer Science, University of Oxford
- expertise: Open networks, cospan categories, theory of compositionality

> Brendan created the cospans compositional framework for networks. He wishes we all thought more in terms of systems. It would be great: We'd understand how program fragments interrelate, and whether these relationships will cause bugs. We'd understand ecosystems and climate systems, and how our actions impact our environment. We'd understand the multifaceted nature of complex disease, and how to respond with multifaceted treatments. We'd understand how our lives are intertwined, and the causes of injustice. Or we'd at least be very slightly better at it. In any case, Brendan thinks and writes about categories from his office at the MIT math department, because these help us reason about systems. Statebox helps too.

## Robin Piedeleu

Robin is helping us in linking different Petri net formalisms into a broader, unique mathematical theory.

- affiliation: Quantum Group, University of Oxford
- education: PhD Computer Science, University of Oxford
- expertise: Category theory, PROPS, open systems

> Robin is broadly interested in the idea of composition: how parts make up a whole and how the whole comes to be more than the sum of its parts. To attack this problem he uses various weapons in the category theoretic arsenal. Recently, he has become obsessed with another Robin's idea of processes: "The meaning of a program should express its history of access to resources which are not local to it." -- Robin Milner. Consequently he has been busy developing a theory of how processes access, use and share ressources (physical, computational etc.).
